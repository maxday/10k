# Ideas of what to develop
- a desktop replicated in css html.
- a mobile phone recreated in pure css.
- a nice way to present the 2016 Rio Olympic table of medals (drill down by sports, countries, bronze/silver/gold), diff with London2012
- some sort of game...no ideas what and how without js
- an url shorterner
