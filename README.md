# 10 Kolors a 10KApart project
This is a web application to be able to detect and extract the main colors from any images.
- from a local image (browsing it or with drag & drop)
- from an online image hosted somewhere
- typing directly a website; our software will take care of creating aprint-screen for you
An you will have all the main colors detected and displayed to you.

You can save the url and see your palette of color whenever you want.
You can export the palette colors in HEX, sass, less.
We are not storing ANY printscreen or images.


The project it is multilangul and.....All stay under 10KiloByte to partecipate to the competition

# Evolutions
In the future we would love to implement:
- export in more formats; rgb, photoshop, png ...
- display the gradient in different ways
- display the color by amount in the image
- in settings refine the details of colors found in the image
- display in the results the image (source of the palette)
