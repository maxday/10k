## Projects
We could create 3 projects and submit them all to have more chance.

# How to develop
- without javascript.
- if we use images better use svg.
- heavy use of css all minifed with shortest selector names.

## Questions:
1. can we use canvas with JS?  (I guess no)
2. js it is counted in the 10k, if loaded from external?
3. external font like google fond loaded via cdn count in the 10k?
4. favicon count in the 10k?
5. images loaded from external website count in the 10k if not embeded?
